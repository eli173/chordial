A chorded keyboard emulator for Linux with X11, inspired by the chorded keyboard used in the [Mother of all Demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY). All configuration happens at compile-time in `config.c`, if there are any major changes to this project in the future the first will be towards easier configuration.
